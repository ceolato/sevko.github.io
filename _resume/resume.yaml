        description: Worked on performance regression testing at MongoDB.
        details:
          - focused on test analysis, which consumes the diagnostic data produced by performance tests and tries to
            identify performance regressions based on throughput over time, resource usage, logs, etc.
          - improved our analysis logic, making it flag errors more intelligently and digest more diagnostic data
          - added linting, testing, and helpful tooling to our Python codebase
