		<h1>about</h1>
		<p>
			I'm Severyn Kozak, a software engineer based in New York City. This site doubles as a professional resource and a
			tech blog, which I'll use to document my adventures in software-development and computer science; hopefully
			others will even find some of it useful. I'm currently taking my pre-college gap year and work at
			<a href="https://mapzen.com/">Mapzen</a>, an open-source and open-date GIS startup. I spend my free time hacking
			on various captivating projects, learning as much as possible, and enjoying the little things.
